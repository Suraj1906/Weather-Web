## APPROACH AND CHALLENGES üõ†Ô∏è  

### Approach  

1. **HTML Structure**:  
   The app is built with a clean and semantic HTML structure. It includes sections for granting location access, searching for a city, displaying loading states, and showing weather information.  

2. **CSS Styling**:  
   The CSS is designed to be responsive and visually appealing. It uses a gradient background, custom fonts, and flexible layouts to ensure the app looks great on all devices.  

3. **JavaScript Logic**:  
   The app uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and dynamically update the DOM. Key features include:  
   - **Tab Switching**: Toggles between "Your Weather" and "Search Weather" tabs.  
   - **Geolocation**: Fetches the user's current location and displays weather data.  
   - **Temperature Conversion**: Allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  
   - **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid city names.  

### Challenges and Solutions  

1. **Geolocation Permissions**:  
   - **Challenge**: Users need to grant location access to fetch weather data for their current location.  
   - **Solution**: The app uses the `navigator.geolocation` API to request permission and handle user coordinates. If denied, it gracefully falls back to the search functionality.  

2. **API Rate Limits**:  
   - **Challenge**: The OpenWeatherMap API has rate limits, which can cause issues if too many requests are made.  
   - **Solution**: The app stores user coordinates in `sessionStorage` to minimize API calls and provides clear error messages for invalid requests.  

3. **Temperature Unit Conversion**:  
   - **Challenge**: Users may prefer different temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit).  
   - **Solution**: The app includes a toggle button that dynamically converts and updates the temperature display.  

4. **Error Handling for Invalid Cities**:  
   - **Challenge**: If a user enters an invalid city name, the app needs to handle the error gracefully.  
   - **Solution**: The app displays a user-friendly error message below the search input and clears it when a valid city is entered.
